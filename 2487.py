"""
You are given the head of a linked list.

Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
Output: [13,8]
Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,1,1,1]
Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
